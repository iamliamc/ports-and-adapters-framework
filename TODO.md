Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, you need to install FastAPI, Celery, and a message broker like Redis.

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi celery[redis] uvicorn
Step 2: Set Up Celery Configuration
Create a file called celery_config.py for Celery configuration.

python
Copy code
# celery_config.py
from celery import Celery

# Initialize Celery
celery_app = Celery(
    'worker',
    broker='redis://localhost:6379/0',
    backend='redis://localhost:6379/0',
    include=['tasks']
)

# Celery configuration
celery_app.conf.update(
    result_expires=3600,
)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    celery_app.start()
Step 3: Define Your Tasks
Create a file called tasks.py to define your background tasks.

python
Copy code
# tasks.py
from celery_config import celery_app

@celery_app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
Step 4: Create the FastAPI App
Create your FastAPI app and set up endpoints to trigger the background tasks.

python
Copy code
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
from tasks import add

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/add/{x}/{y}")
async def add_numbers(x: int, y: int, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    result = add.apply_async((x, y))
    background_tasks.add_task(log_task_result, result.id)
    return {"message": "Task added to the background", "task_id": result.id}

def log_task_result(task_id: str):
    from celery.result import AsyncResult
    result = AsyncResult(task_id)
    print(f"Task {task_id} completed with result: {result.result}")

# Start the FastAPI server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
Step 5: Run Celery Worker
Run the Celery worker from the command line:

bash
Copy code
celery -A celery_config.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
Step 6: Start FastAPI Server
Run your FastAPI server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Step 7: Test the Setup
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/add/5/7. You should see a response indicating that the task has been added to the background.

Additional Considerations
Error Handling: Implement error handling for tasks to manage failures.
Periodic Tasks: Use Celery's beat to schedule periodic tasks if needed.
Deployment: Make sure Redis and Celery workers are properly configured and monitored in your production environment.
By following these steps, you should be able to integrate background processing into your FastAPI application using Celery, providing similar functionality to Sidekiq.

ChatGPT
To manage running both the FastAPI server and the Celery worker simultaneously, you can use Overmind. Overmind is a process manager that can run multiple commands in parallel, which is especially useful in development environments.

Step 1: Install Overmind
First, you need to install Overmind. You can download it from here or use Homebrew if you're on macOS:

bash
Copy code
brew install overmind
Step 2: Create a Procfile
Create a Procfile in the root of your project directory. This file will define the processes you want to run.

bash
Copy code
# Procfile
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
worker: celery -A celery_config.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
Step 3: Run Overmind
Run Overmind in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
overmind start
Overmind will read the Procfile and start both the FastAPI server and the Celery worker, managing their outputs and restarts.

Additional Configuration
Environment Variables: If you have environment variables, you can use a .env file or set them directly in the Procfile.

bash
Copy code
# Procfile
web: env $(cat .env) uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
worker: env $(cat .env) celery -A celery_config.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
Monitoring: Overmind provides a web UI to monitor processes. By default, it runs on port 5555. You can access it by navigating to http://localhost:5555.

By using Overmind, you can easily manage both the FastAPI server and Celery worker, making your development process more streamlined and efficient.
