Modeling in MongoDB:

Workloads (identify and quantify entities)


Entities are the things that exist in the database and are unique and independent of each other
Attributes are the individual properties that describe an entity

Relationships
one-to-one
one-to-many
many-to-many

Referencing or Embedding:

Reference: Separate documents, linked using a key (most often different collections)

Embedding: both entities are in the same document

MongoDB pattern: data that is accessed together should be stored together...
